# The Polymath Protocol: High-Fidelity System Prompt

> **Archived from my *Chorus* multi-model workflow.**

Cognitive Architecture system prompt designed to force Large Language Models (LLMs) out of their default "conversational" mode and into a **First Principles** thinking mode.

It was originally developed to standardize output quality across different models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) within the *Chorus* app.

## ⚡ The Problem
Default LLMs are trained to be "helpful assistants." When asked for advice, they tend to:
1.  **Platitudes:** Offer generic encouragement ("It's never too late!").
2.  **Fluff:** Waste tokens on preambles ("That's a great question, here is a list...").
3.  **Surface Level:** Regurgitate SEO-style listicles rather than expert nuance.

## 🧠 The Solution (How it Works)
The Polymath Protocol uses specific instruction sets to override these behaviors:
*   **First Principles Thinking:** Breaks queries down to fundamental truths before generating.
*   **The "Pro" Nuance:** Explicitly instructs the model to look for edge cases and "hidden variables."
*   **Information Architecture:** Forces the use of **Tables**, **Bolding**, and **Headers** to increase information density.

## 🧪 The "A/B" Test

We tested this prompt on **Gemini 3 Pro Prview** with a subjective strategy question. The difference in logical structuring and actionable advice is immediate.

**The Prompt:** *"I want to start a substack blog about music. come up with a strategy"*

Starting a Substack about "music" is broad, so the key to success is narrowing your focus to a specific "angle" or "lens." General music reviews are saturated; readers today want curation, narrative, or specific expertise.

Here is a comprehensive strategy to launch and grow a successful music Substack in 2025.

**Phase 1: Define Your "Blue Ocean" Angle**

Don't just write "reviews." Choose a specific format or constraint that makes your publication unique. Here are four high-potential concepts:

*   **The "Micro-Genre" Historian:** Pick a very specific scene (e.g., "Japanese City Pop," "90s Midwest Emo," "UK Garage") and become the definitive archive for it.
*   **The "Playlister" Plus:** Don’t just share a Spotify link. Write a 200-word blurb for every song explaining the context, the sample used, or why the bridge is genius.
*   **The "Industry Decoder":** If you have a background in the business, write about the money and tech behind the music (e.g., "How touring economics actually work").
*   **The "Contextualizer":** Connect music to something else—history, food, or mental health. Example: "Albums to cook Italian food to" or "The politics of 1970s punk."

**Phase 2: Content Structure & Cadence**

Substack rewards consistency. You need a mix of "Free" content (to grow) and "Paid" content (to monetize later).

*   **The "Weekly 1-2 Punch" Schedule:**
    *   *Tuesday (Deep Dive - Long Form):* A 1,000-word essay, artist interview, or album retrospective. Goal: Authority and trust.
    *   *Friday (The "Digest" - Short Form):* A curated list. "5 Songs You Need to Hear This Weekend" or "Best Music Journalism I Read This Week." Goal: Shareability and habit-building.

**Phase 3: Growth Strategy (The "Network Effect")**

Substack is different from a blog because of its internal recommendation network.

*   **The "Notes" Strategy:** Use Substack Notes (their Twitter-like feed) to post short takes, share lyrics, or ask questions like "What is the best opening track of all time?" This drives traffic to your newsletter better than Twitter/X.
*   **Recommendation Swaps:** Identify 5-10 other music Substacks with similar subscriber counts (even if they are small). DM or email them: "I love your newsletter on Jazz. I write about Funk. If you recommend my publication in your sidebar, I'll recommend yours."

**Phase 4: Monetization (When to turn it on)**

Do not turn on paid subscriptions until you have at least 500-1,000 free subscribers. You need a funnel first. Once you do, offer:
*   **The "Vault":** Access to the full archive of past posts.
*   **Community:** Paid-only comment threads or a Discord server where you discuss new albums together.

### Core Philosophy: The "Curator vs. Analyst" Dichotomy

Success on Substack requires abandoning the generalist "Music Reviewer" model. That market is saturated by legacy media (Pitchfork, Rolling Stone) and YouTubers (Fantano).

To succeed, you must pivot to one of two high-value positions:
1.  **The Hyper-Curator:** You save the reader time by filtering noise in a specific micro-genre.
2.  **The Industry Analyst:** You explain *how* and *why* music is happening, focusing on economics, history, or theory.

### Phase 1: Niche Selection & Positioning

"Music" is not a niche. It is a category. You must drill down three layers to find a viable audience.

| Strategy | Saturated (Low Value) | Viable (Medium Value) | **High-Signal (High Value)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genre** | "Indie Rock Reviews" | "90s Shoegaze History" | "Japanese City Pop & its Modern Derivatives" |
| **Format** | "Album Reviews" | "Weekly Playlists" | "One Song Deconstructed: Theory + Production Analysis" |
| **Industry** | "Music News" | "Streaming Stats" | "The Web3/AI impact on Independent Rights Management" |
| **Vibe** | "Cool Stuff I Like" | "Underrated Gems" | "Music for Deep Work: Instrumental & Ambient Curation" |

**Strategic Directive:** Choose a "High-Signal" angle. The narrower the focus, the higher the conversion rate from free to paid.

---

### Phase 2: Content Architecture (The Product)

Do not rely on inspiration. Construct a **Content Matrix** to ensure consistency. You need a mix of "Flow" content (easy to produce, keeps list warm) and "Stock" content (high effort, drives subscriptions).

#### The 3-Tier Content Cadence

| Tier | Frequency | Format | Purpose | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Signal** | Weekly (Friday) | 5 Links, 1 Album, 1 Take. | Retention. Keeps you in the inbox. High open rate. | **Free** |
| **The Deep Dive** | Bi-Weekly | 1,500+ word essay on history, theory, or economics. | Authority. This is the content that goes viral/gets shared. | **Free (initially)** |
| **The Vault** | Monthly | Archival audio, community Q&A, detailed playlists. | Value capture. Hard-core fan service. | **Paid** |

**Formatting Rule:** Use Substack’s audio embed features. If you write about a song, the reader *must* be able to play it within the email.

### Phase 3: The Growth Engine (Substack Specifics)

Substack is no longer just an email provider; it is a social network. You must leverage the internal ecosystem.

**1. The Recommendation Engine**
*   **Mechanism:** When someone subscribes to Newsletter A, they are asked to subscribe to Newsletter B.
*   **Tactic:** Identify 10-20 Substacks in adjacent niches (e.g., if you write about Jazz, target "Hi-Fi Audio" and "Modern History" newsletters). Reach out to the authors for cross-promotion or simply recommend them first to trigger reciprocity.

**2. Substack Notes**
*   **Mechanism:** Twitter-like feed within the app.
*   **Tactic:** Do not post links to your posts. Post *excerpts* or "micro-takes."
*   **Example:** Don't say "New post on Oasis." Post a screenshot of a specific lyric comparison with a bold claim about their production techniques.

**3. The "Lead Magnet" Playlist**
*   Create a Spotify/Apple Music playlist that is **only** accessible via a link in your Welcome Email.
*   Title it aggressively: *"The only 50 Shoegaze tracks that actually matter."*

### Phase 4: Monetization Economics

Do not turn on paid subscriptions immediately. Use the following roadmap:

*   **0 – 500 Subscribers:** **100% Free.** Focus strictly on growth and voice refinement.
*   **500 – 1,000 Subscribers:** Turn on "Pledges." This allows super-fans to pay you voluntarily without gating content.
*   **1,000+ Subscribers:** Launch Paid Tier.

**Pricing Psychology:**
*   **Standard:** $5/month is the floor.
*   **Founder Tier:** $150/year. Offer a tangible benefit (e.g., a vinyl record, a 1-on-1 music consult, access to a private Discord). *Note: This tier often generates 30% of total revenue.*
