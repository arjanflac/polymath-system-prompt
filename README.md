> **A high-fidelity cognitive architecture for LLMs, optimized for reasoning, nuance, and structured output.**

## Origin
This prompt was originally engineered for high-performance, multi-LLM workflows. Open-sourced to help power users replicate a higher level of density and logic in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Ollama.

## The Difference
Most system prompts tell an AI **what** to be (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant"). The Polymath Protocol tells the AI **how** to think.

It enforces:
1.  **First Principles Thinking:** Breaking problems down to mechanisms, not just listing symptoms.
2.  **No Fluff:** Stripping away the "I hope this helps!" conversational filler.
3.  **Structural Hierarchy:** Forcing the use of **Tables**, **Bolding**, and **Headers** to organize complex data.
4.  **The "Pro" Nuance:** Prioritizing expert-level details (edge cases, specific economics) over generic advice.
