# Polymath System Prompt

> **A high-fidelity cognitive architecture for LLMs, optimized for reasoning, nuance, and structured output.**

[**[Click here for the raw prompt text]**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arjanflac/polymath-system-prompt/main/prompt.md)

## Origin
This prompt was originally engineered for high-performance, multi-LLM workflows. Open-sourced to help power users replicate a higher level of density and logic in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Ollama.

## The Difference
Most system prompts tell an AI **what** to be (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant"). The Polymath Protocol tells the AI **how** to think.

It enforces:
1.  **First Principles Thinking:** Breaking problems down to mechanisms, not just listing symptoms.
2.  **No Fluff:** Stripping away the "I hope this helps!" conversational filler.
3.  **Structural Hierarchy:** Forcing the use of **Tables**, **Bolding**, and **Headers** to organize complex data.
4.  **The "Pro" Nuance:** Prioritizing expert-level details (edge cases, specific economics) over generic advice.

## The A/B Test
To demonstrate the difference in cognitive density, tested both a standard model and the Polymath Prompt with the same query on **Gemini 3 Pro Preview**.

**The Query:** *"I want to start a substack blog about music. Come up with a strategy."*

### Before: Standard Model Response
*Generic advice, listicle format.*

Starting a Substack about "music" is broad, so the key to success is narrowing your focus to a specific "angle" or "lens." General music reviews are saturated; readers today want **curation, narrative, or specific expertise.**

Here is a comprehensive strategy to launch and grow a successful music Substack in 2025.

### Phase 1: Define Your "Blue Ocean" Angle
Don't just write "reviews." Choose a specific format or constraint that makes your publication unique. Here are four high-potential concepts:

*   **The "Micro-Genre" Historian:** Pick a very specific scene (e.g., "Japanese City Pop," "90s Midwest Emo," "UK Garage") and become the definitive archive for it.
*   **The "Playlister" Plus:** Don’t just share a Spotify link. Write a 200-word blurb for *every* song explaining the context, the sample used, or why the bridge is genius.
*   **The "Industry Decoder":** If you have a background in the business, write about the *money* and *tech* behind the music (e.g., "How touring economics actually work").
*   **The "Contextualizer":** Connect music to something else—history, food, or mental health. Example: *"Albums to cook Italian food to"* or *"The politics of 1970s punk."*

### Phase 2: Content Structure & Cadence
Substack rewards consistency. You need a mix of "Free" content (to grow) and "Paid" content (to monetize later).

**The "Weekly 1-2 Punch" Schedule:**
*   **Tuesday (Deep Dive - Long Form):** A 1,000-word essay, artist interview, or album retrospective.
    *   *Goal:* Authority and trust.
*   **Friday (The "Digest" - Short Form):** A curated list. "5 Songs You Need to Hear This Weekend" or "Best Music Journalism I Read This Week."
    *   *Goal:* Shareability and habit-building.

**Key Feature to Use:** **Substack Audio/Podcast.**
Substack allows you to embed audio players directly. Since you are writing about music, *include the music*.
*   *Tip:* Use the "Voiceover" feature to read your posts aloud for commuters, or embed a Spotify/Apple Music track directly into the text so people can listen while they read.

### Phase 3: Growth Strategy (The "Network Effect")
Substack is different from a blog because of its internal recommendation network.

1.  **The "Notes" Strategy:** Use Substack Notes (their Twitter-like feed) to post short takes, share lyrics, or ask questions like "What is the best opening track of all time?" This drives traffic to your newsletter better than Twitter/X.
2.  **Recommendation Swaps:** Identify 5-10 other music Substacks with similar subscriber counts (even if they are small). DM or email them: *"I love your newsletter on Jazz. I write about Funk. If you recommend my publication in your sidebar, I'll recommend yours."*
3.  **Cross-Platform Funnel:**
    *   **TikTok/Reels:** Post a 30-second clip of a song with text: *"The backstory of this song is insane - read the full story in my bio."*
    *   **Reddit:** Find the subreddit for the specific genre you write about. Post your full article there (don't just drop a link). At the bottom, say *"If you liked this deep dive, I send one out every Tuesday here [Link]."*

### Phase 4: The Launch Timeline (0 to 100 Subscribers)

*   **Week 1: The "Stockpile"**
    *   Write 3 full posts before you launch. You don't want to be scrambling in week 2.
    *   Set up your "About" page. This is the most important page—it must answer: "What will I get?" and "When will I get it?"

*   **Week 2: The "Soft Launch"**
    *   Publish your first post.
    *   Email every friend and colleague personally (don't BCC). "I'm starting a music project about [Topic]. I'd love if you signed up."
    *   *Goal:* 20-50 subscribers (Friends & Family).

*   **Week 3: The "Network" Push**
    *   Turn on "Recommendations" in your settings.
    *   Engage in the comments sections of big music Substacks (like *The Honest Broker* or *Flow State*). Write thoughtful comments, not spam. People will click your profile and see your publication.

*   **Week 4: The "Value" Post**
    *   Publish a "Resource" post. Examples: *"The Ultimate Guide to Vinyl Collecting in 2025"* or *"A Flowchart to get into Radiohead."*
    *   These are highly shareable and bring in strangers.

### Phase 5: Monetization (When to turn it on)
**Do not turn on paid subscriptions until you have at least 500-1,000 free subscribers.** You need a funnel first.

Once you do, offer:
*   **The "Vault":** Access to the full archive of past posts.
*   **Community:** Paid-only comment threads or a Discord server where you discuss new albums together.
*   **Curation:** A monthly "Deep Cuts" playlist that isn't available to free subscribers.

### Summary Checklist
1.  [ ] Pick a specific niche (not just "music reviews").
2.  [ ] Commit to one essay and one roundup per week.
3.  [ ] Write 3 posts before launching.
4.  [ ] Use Substack Notes to find your first strangers.
5.  [ ] Embed audio in every single post.

### Core Philosophy: The "Curator vs. Analyst" Dichotomy

Success on Substack requires abandoning the generalist "Music Reviewer" model. That market is saturated by legacy media (Pitchfork, Rolling Stone) and YouTubers (Fantano).

To succeed, you must pivot to one of two high-value positions:
1.  **The Hyper-Curator:** You save the reader time by filtering noise in a specific micro-genre.
2.  **The Industry Analyst:** You explain *how* and *why* music is happening, focusing on economics, history, or theory.

### Phase 1: Niche Selection & Positioning

"Music" is not a niche. It is a category. You must drill down three layers to find a viable audience.

| Strategy | Saturated (Low Value) | Viable (Medium Value) | **High-Signal (High Value)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genre** | "Indie Rock Reviews" | "90s Shoegaze History" | "Japanese City Pop & its Modern Derivatives" |
| **Format** | "Album Reviews" | "Weekly Playlists" | "One Song Deconstructed: Theory + Production Analysis" |
| **Industry** | "Music News" | "Streaming Stats" | "The Web3/AI impact on Independent Rights Management" |
| **Vibe** | "Cool Stuff I Like" | "Underrated Gems" | "Music for Deep Work: Instrumental & Ambient Curation" |

**Strategic Directive:** Choose a "High-Signal" angle. The narrower the focus, the higher the conversion rate from free to paid.

---

### Phase 2: Content Architecture (The Product)

Do not rely on inspiration. Construct a **Content Matrix** to ensure consistency. You need a mix of "Flow" content (easy to produce, keeps list warm) and "Stock" content (high effort, drives subscriptions).

#### The 3-Tier Content Cadence

| Tier | Frequency | Format | Purpose | Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Signal** | Weekly (Friday) | 5 Links, 1 Album, 1 Take. | Retention. Keeps you in the inbox. High open rate. | **Free** |
| **The Deep Dive** | Bi-Weekly | 1,500+ word essay on history, theory, or economics. | Authority. This is the content that goes viral/gets shared. | **Free (initially)** |
| **The Vault** | Monthly | Archival audio, community Q&A, detailed playlists. | Value capture. Hard-core fan service. | **Paid** |

**Formatting Rule:** Use Substack’s audio embed features. If you write about a song, the reader *must* be able to play it within the email.

---

### Phase 3: The Growth Engine (Substack Specifics)

Substack is no longer just an email provider; it is a social network. You must leverage the internal ecosystem.

**1. The Recommendation Engine**
*   **Mechanism:** When someone subscribes to Newsletter A, they are asked to subscribe to Newsletter B.
*   **Tactic:** Identify 10-20 Substacks in adjacent niches (e.g., if you write about Jazz, target "Hi-Fi Audio" and "Modern History" newsletters). Reach out to the authors for cross-promotion or simply recommend them first to trigger reciprocity.

**2. Substack Notes**
*   **Mechanism:** Twitter-like feed within the app.
*   **Tactic:** Do not post links to your posts. Post *excerpts* or "micro-takes."
*   **Example:** Don't say "New post on Oasis." Post a screenshot of a specific lyric comparison with a bold claim about their production techniques.

**3. The "Lead Magnet" Playlist**
*   Create a Spotify/Apple Music playlist that is **only** accessible via a link in your Welcome Email.
*   Title it aggressively: *"The only 50 Shoegaze tracks that actually matter."*

---

### Phase 4: Monetization Economics

Do not turn on paid subscriptions immediately. Use the following roadmap:

*   **0 – 500 Subscribers:** **100% Free.** Focus strictly on growth and voice refinement.
*   **500 – 1,000 Subscribers:** Turn on "Pledges." This allows super-fans to pay you voluntarily without gating content.
*   **1,000+ Subscribers:** Launch Paid Tier.

**Pricing Psychology:**
*   **Standard:** $5/month is the floor.
*   **Founder Tier:** $150/year. Offer a tangible benefit (e.g., a vinyl record, a 1-on-1 music consult, access to a private Discord). *Note: This tier often generates 30% of total revenue.*

### Execution Checklist: Day 1 to Day 30

1.  **Name & Design:** One-word name or "The [Noun]." Clean, high-contrast logo. No musical notes in the logo (cliché).
2.  **The "About" Page:** This is your sales page. Do not write a bio. Write a manifesto. Tell them what they will *learn* or *feel*, not who you are.
3.  **Seed Content:** Launch with **3 posts** already published. No one subscribes to an empty archive.
    *   *Post 1:* The Manifesto (Why this exists).
    *   *Post 2:* A High-Effort Deep Dive (Proof of competence).
    *   *Post 3:* A Curation List (Proof of taste).
4.  **Import Audience:** Export contacts from Gmail/LinkedIn. Upload the CSV. Send one "opt-in" email (do not force subscribe).

**Final Warning:** The music space is noisy. You win by being **analytical** about the art, or **fanatical** about the curation. The middle ground is death.
